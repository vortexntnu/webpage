                <h2>A Few Words About Us</h2>
                                <p><h5>Vortex NTNU is an independent student organization at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway. Our team is composed of students from different engineering disciplines from bachelor and master degree programs.</h5></p>
                                <p><h5>Each year we conceive, design, and build an ROV from scratch to compete in the MATE international ROV competition. We dive headfirst into a diversity of challenges in an effort to push our boundaries and improve skills in communication, management, and engineering.</h5></p>
                                <p><h5>We are passionate about science and technology, and we provide an ideal opportunity for ambitious students to explore and develop their talents and skills in a collaborative undertaking. Through the project, we demonstrate that we can deliver a complex and integrated product in the demanding environment of an underwater competition.</h5></p>
